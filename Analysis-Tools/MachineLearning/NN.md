## A First look at a neural network (NN)

- In machine learning, a category in a classification problem is called a _class_. Data points are called _samples_. The _class_ associated with a specific sample is called a _label_.

- _Training set_ : The data that the model will learn from. The model will then be tested on the _test set_

- The workflow is as following: Feed the NN the training data, NN will learn to associate images and labels, then ask the NN to produce predictions for the _test set_ and we'll verify whether these predictiones match the labels or not.

- The core building block of a NN is the _layer_ (data processing module that works as a filter for data).
