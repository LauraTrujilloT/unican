# Monte Carlo Event Generation

##Outline

- Overview MC methods

## Introduction

- The MC simulation role is to mimic what happens in the
  spectrometers to understand experimental conditions and
  performance.


-

**Why you should use MC simulations?**
- You want to generate events in as much detail as possible (i.e get average and fluctuations right, make random choices and so one).

**LHC Collision**
- QCD Hard collision large pT $Q^2$ (ocassionally)
- Parton showers: Starts from the hard process and works downwards to lower and lower momentum scales to a point $\sim 1GeV$. For instance, accelerated electric charges emit QED radiation (photons) and accelerated coloured photons will emit QCD radiation.
- Underlying event: There may be additional semihard process called multiple partonic.
- Confinement/hadronization:  at this scale, the partonic degrees of freedom (doF) are converted into hadrons via hadronization mode.

_What can we compute?_ Master formula: **QCD factorization**

- Parton level cross section from matrix element.
- Parton density functions
- s = collision energy of the collider
